A project from the Intermediate HTML &amp; CSS course on the Full-Stack JavaScript Path on The Odin Project.

## Reflection

This project focuses on applying the concept of CSS Grid.

### Wins
- Managed to create a fixed sidebar and search bar with grid.
- The use of SVG for icons

### Hurdles
- My obsession with the perfect design -- _This_ really held me back during my time building this. Because of this, I wasn't able to move quick and the project took longer than expected.

That one particular hurdle forced me to deploy an MVP (Minimum Viable Product) so that I could get a sense of completion. I was initially planning to add more features to this (e.g. animation, styling input controls, responsiveness, etc.) but I decided to do them for another day. I'll make sure I'll write up an issue outlining the features I still want to implement.
